## 1. Product-Wise Sales Report (Fiscal Year 2021)

**Domain:** Sales Analytics & Revenue Reporting  

### Objective
To build a product-level sales report for a given fiscal year that accurately aligns sales data with pricing data, ensuring correct revenue calculations.

A key challenge in this task was handling fiscal year logic (Apr–Mar) instead of calendar years.

### Key Features
- Custom fiscal year function for accurate date-to-FY mapping  
- Product-wise and variant-wise sales analysis  
- Sold quantity and gross price per unit  
- Total gross revenue calculation  
- Correct pricing alignment using fiscal year logic  
- Clean, reusable, and scalable SQL design  

---

### SQL Concepts Used
- User-defined SQL functions  
- Inner joins across fact and dimension tables  
- Fiscal year–based filtering and joins  
- Calculated columns for revenue  
- Sorting and reporting logic

### Output
The final SQL query generates a product-wise sales report containing:
- Date / Month

- Variant  
- Sold Quantity  
- Gross Price per Item  
- Gross Price Total  

The result is exported to Excel for easy business analysis and sharing.
